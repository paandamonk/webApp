# webApp
The features I will be putting into my exercise app will be:

Create your own account, personalize the app to your needs. 

Calorie Counter, +/- inputs for exercising and diet.

Goal setting for weight loss/gain. Input weight every morning before breakfast.

Goal setting for physical activity done each day. Input how many minutes of physical activity you performed whenever you exercise.

Weekly report graphs showing progress related to Goals set for exercising and weight loss/gain.

Horizontal Navigation bar on the top of the screen for homepage, help/FAQ, and login/logout.

Second Vertical Navigation bar on the left side of the screen to switch between the Summary screen, Calorie Counter, and Goal Setting screens, and a History screen.


The first screen will be the homepage. If you are not logged in already, you can create your account right there. If you are logged in, it will default to the Summary Screen.

The Summary screen will display your daily Calorie intake, Calories burned, and daily weight in weekly graphs to allow you to see your progress. There will also be graphs showing how close you are to achieving your goals. IE, on weight graph, it will show two lines, one horizontal representing the weight you are trying to achieve, and another that consists of the daily weight inputs.

The Calorie Counter screen will allow you to input how many calories you are taking in and add them up to a total throughout the day. You will also be able to write in what physical activity you performed and how many calories it burned and it will add it up throughout the day.

The Goal Setting screen just allows you to set a goal for your ideal weight and for how much time you'd like to spend on physical activity each day.

The History Screen will display a time-stamped feed of everything you input into the app so that you may review your progress. (Time permitting, I'd also like to make this editable, so that in the event someone inputs data incorrectly, they have the power to fix it themselves).
